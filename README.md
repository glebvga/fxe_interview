# FX EMPIRE interview task by Gleb Volodin

### Considerations:
- I didn't use Redux Middleware for API calls, as Redux is generally an overkill for this app.
- At first I planned to build graphs on D3.JS, but reconsidered in favor of Plotly.js library that is based on D3, but has some pre-configured graph types.
- I used react-tabs for simple tab control.
- I used the build-react-app tool to quicken the development, as suggested.
